1.) Make circles slightly bigger so Goggles fits in (or make Goggles smaller, but probably want Goggles to be big enough to notice all the little details)
2.) Change Goggles starting position and provide affordance/instruction (maybe in a box?) 
3.) Could the instructions be put on screen as the detective enters into each circle? Maybe we can have a standard box (at the top left/right maybe?) where new instructions appear (this can be triggered from droppable) 

4.) Crime scene #1 etc. titles below the circles
5.) Choosing a new color when a location is visited


Note: Everything looks really good right now!
